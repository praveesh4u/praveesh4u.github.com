After coding in Symfony for a long two years, I had to switch to CodeIgniter due to job switching. I have to say that CodeIgniter is a really ancient PHP framework when compared with Symfony. People say code igniter is a light weight framework, it has small footprint and etc. Seriously, who gives a damn? As long as there is option for vertical scaling, who cares about the memory foot print of the framework?
