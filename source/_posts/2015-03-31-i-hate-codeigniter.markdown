After coding in Symfony for a good two years, I had to switch to CodeIgniter due to job switching. I have to say that CodeIgniter is a really ancient PHP framework when compared with Symfony. People say code igniter is a light weight framework, it has small footprint and etc. Seriously, who gives a damn?
