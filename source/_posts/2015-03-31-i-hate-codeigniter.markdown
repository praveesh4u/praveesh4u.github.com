As a web developer, most of the PHP projects in which I was involved were based on Symfony2. Symfony2 is a PHP  framework that follows MVC pattern and uses Symfony components as its core building blocks. The power, flexibility and control that these components offer makes the development process far easier and organized compared to writing code in plain PHP. 

After coding in Symfony for a long two years and delivering a handful of large enterprise level projects, I HAD to work on a project that was based on CodeIgniter as I switched my job. I HAVE to say that CodeIgniter is really ancient when compared with Symfony. People say code igniter is a light weight framework, it has small footprint and etc. No matter what the justifications, I find it quite hard to digest why people are still using something which is outdated and which contradicts a lot of best practices and norms that are followed in modern day web development. I wonder who gives a damn about the small footprint and size of the framework? As long as there is option for vertical scaling and caching, who cares about the memory foot print of the framework? May be some people still does.
